## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of AI Agents, focusing on their frameworks, applications in supply chain management, ethical considerations, and challenges in real-world deployments. The assignment includes short-answer theoretical questions, a detailed case study analysis for AutoParts Inc., and a simulated AI Agent workflow created on no-code platforms.

***

## Short Answer Questions
Provides concise answers covering:
- Differences between LangChain and AutoGen frameworks  
- AI Agents' impact on supply chain management  
- Concept and significance of Human-Agent Symbiosis  
- Ethical issues in autonomous AI financial decision-making  
- Challenges in memory/state management of AI Agents  

***

## Case Study Analysis
An in-depth strategy for implementing AI Agents at AutoParts Inc. addressing:
- Quality control with defect detection agents  
- Predictive maintenance agents to reduce downtime  
- Customization and order management agents for faster delivery  
Includes ROI estimates, timeline, risks, and mitigation strategies.

***

## Simulation
The AI Agent workflows are simulated using [n8n](https://n8n.io/) / [make.com](https://www.make.com/). The simulation replicates defect reporting, predictive alerts, and adaptive scheduling demonstrating practical feasibility.
